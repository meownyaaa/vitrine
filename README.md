# Mirage

**Mirage** is a fork of [Vitrine](https://github.com/meownyaaa/vitrine), which is itself the GPL-3.0 fork of
[Chroma](https://github.com/skopevoj/spoti.pw) (up to v0.21.1). It adds a second tweak, `mirage/`, next to
Vitrine's own:

- **Custom backgrounds**: a picture (PNG/JPG/HEIC), a GIF (converted to a looping MP4) or a video
  (MP4/MOV, muted, without touching Spotify's audio session), with blur, dim, scale mode and a choice of
  Home / Now Playing / Library / Everywhere. It sits behind Vitrine's liquid glass.
- A **Mirage** row in the side drawer, right below Vitrine's *Mod Settings*, that opens Mirage's settings.
- **Mirage DJ** (0.2.0): an AI DJ that uses your own API key (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Groq, xAI, Perplexity,
  Cerebras, Fireworks, Together, DeepSeek, Mistral) to pick sets from your taste and talk between tracks. Since 0.3.0: voices
  (iPhone, provider, ElevenLabs), personas, a chat that answers from your listening history and makes playlists. Since 0.4.0:
  artist-aware sets, taste from what you actually play, talks like you, player controls and likes, its own settings page. Since 0.4.1:
  an artist plays their whole catalog then similar artists, labels/crews ("yvl"), playlists/albums/Liked Songs, the queue is replaced
  on every new request, and voice presets with fine controls. Since 0.4.2: the set is checked against Spotify's real queue and
  repaired, picks stay near your seeds, the vibe box answers questions, artist/song info cards with sources, two new voice presets. 0.4.3: the queue crash on tapping a song is fixed, Start follows the song playing now, ElevenLabs Ivy / Nicole / Arabella presets. 0.4.4: those presets really speak with ElevenLabs, and ElevenLabs errors are shown instead of the iPhone voice. 0.5.0: "play <song> by <artist>" plays that song first and then similar music, playlist/album requests, no more overlapping sets or voices, free Microsoft Edge voices (unofficial) as the default plus Qwen TTS with your own key, a backup AI key for rate limits, and the Addon Shop with its first addon, Vinyl.
  See [docs/mirage/AI-DJ.md](docs/mirage/AI-DJ.md).
- Coming next: an **Addon Shop**.

Vitrine's sources (`tweak/`) are kept as upstream ships them, so `git merge upstream/main` stays clean.

- Build: [docs/mirage/BUILDING.md](docs/mirage/BUILDING.md). Linux works through `scripts/mirage-setup-linux.sh` and `scripts/mirage-build.sh`,
  and macOS or GitHub Actions through `.github/workflows/mirage-ipa.yml`.
- Install with Ksign: [docs/mirage/INSTALL.md](docs/mirage/INSTALL.md)

Mirage is licensed GPL-3.0 like Vitrine and Chroma ≤ 0.21.1. Bring your own decrypted Spotify IPA. Neither this
repo nor its workflows publish one.

A no-jailbreak Theos tweak that rebuilds Spotify for iOS in Liquid Glass, injected into your own
decrypted IPA and signed with your own certificate.

Vitrine is a fork of [spoti.pw](https://github.com/skopevoj/spoti.pw) by Vojtěch Škopek, taken from
0.21.1 (commit `c790445`, 2026-09-23), the last version released under GPL-3.0, and modified since.

Built and tested on **Spotify 9.1.78**, **Spotify 9.1.88** and **Spotify 9.1.90**.
The mod hooks Spotify's own classes, which change between releases, so any other version may build and then break.

| | |
|---|---|
| The redesign | **iOS 26+** |
| Legacy look | iOS 16.1+ |
| Live Activity | iOS 17+ |

The redesign is `UIGlassEffect`, which only exists from iOS 26. Below that the Redesigned UI switch
turns it on only after a warning that it is untested there, and a launch with it that hangs goes back
to Spotify's own screens with everything else the mod adds on top. Both live in Settings → Mod Settings.

## Build it

No IPA is distributed. Bring a decrypted **Spotify 9.1.78**, **9.1.88** or **9.1.90** IPA; you get an unsigned
`vitrine-<mod version>.ipa` to sign with SideStore, Feather or any certificate signer. Releases have no `.deb`:
injected by hand, the tweak alone misses the app changes the redesign needs (its glass tab bar), the Live
Activity, Music Haptics in the background and Connect's local discovery, so build the IPA instead.

### Build with GitHub Actions

Fork the repo, enable Actions, run **Build IPA from your own Spotify IPA**. It takes a direct link to
your decrypted `.ipa` and hands the built IPA back as a workflow artifact. No Mac needed; the link is
masked in the log and the result stays in your fork.

### Build on a Mac

Theos in `~/theos` and Xcode with an iPhoneOS 26+ SDK (`xcode-select` it). An SDK in `~/theos/sdks`
alone builds too, but without the Live Activity. Then:

    brew install make ldid dpkg zsign libimobiledevice
    uv tool install "cyan @ git+https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw"

Put the decrypted `.ipa` in `ipa/`, then:

    make release    # out/vitrine-<version>.ipa, ready to sign
    make install    # the same, signed with your certificate and installed over USB or Wi-Fi

`scripts/pipeline.sh <ipa> --no-flex --keep-watch` keeps Spotify's Apple Watch app (**untested**). Only its
arm64 build survives decryption on an iPhone, so it can run only on an Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 or newer, and
it needs a signer that renames the Watch app to your App ID and signs it with a profile of its own that includes the
Watch. `make install` does not do that yet.

`make install` reads `SIGN_P12`, `SIGN_PROFILE` and `SIGN_P12_PASSWORD` from `.signing.env`; copy
`.signing.env.example` and fill it in.

The first build spends a minute reading Spotify's flags out of your IPA. `make flags` regenerates it.

### Signing

Sign with a bundle id matching your certificate's App ID. If it doesn't match, the app still works
but tapping the player on the lock screen won't open it — and it tells you on first launch which id
to use. In Feather, copy the App ID into **Identifier** and leave **PPQ protection** off; AltStore,
SideStore and Sideloadly get this right on their own.

The app keeps Spotify's bundle id, so it installs over the real Spotify.
