// The lock screen's artwork moves: the track's Canvas, else Apple Music's animated album cover, and with
// Every song chosen, failing both, the cover over a moving blur of itself (SGFluidClip.h). iOS 26 takes a
// local video through MPMediaItemAnimatedArtwork under one of two now playing keys, 1:1 or 3:4, of those
// the system lists. It rides on Spotify's now playing info as an extra (Shared/Player/NowPlayingExtras.h).
//
// The system turns down a clip of another shape than its key's, and a preview still of another shape with
// it, so a clip that does not fit (a Canvas is mostly 9:16) is cut to the key's shape about its middle, and
// the still is filled to the size the system asks for. The cut, like the cover's clip, is made only when the
// lock screen asks for the video, and kept: the cut by the clip and shape, the cover's clip by the picture
// the track names, so an album's songs share one.
//
// The choice is read on every track, and a change applies at once: Off takes the clip away, Moving artwork
// and Every song look the playing track up. Lyrics is LyricsArtwork.x's, which reads it the same way, so the
// lock screen widget's star (LockScreenStar.x) can swap the two without a restart. Moving artwork with
// lyrics looks the track up too and hands its clip to LyricsArtwork.x, which draws the lines over it.
